The really important questions to ask about history go beyond ‘what happened,’ and focus on ‘how’ and ‘why.’ This makes history relevant for us in the present.” Steve leads a contingent of SAAS youth legislature students to Olympia each year to write bills that frequently make it onto the docket for debate on the senate and house floor.
